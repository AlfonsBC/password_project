# Neuronal Network Project

The objective is to analyze historic data of passwords from the site called "have i been pwned?" https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords, which is an online free resource of data that has been compromised or "pwned" in a data breach. We want to make a data analysis of the passwords and its security in respect of its historic frequency use. Eventually, We will provide of an implimentation of an algorithm that receives as entry the password (even if it is not included in the dataset) and that determine its security based on a prestablished metric

This repository contains three notebooks:

- Model of a Neuronal Network : Introduction, data exploration and the neuronal network multi-layer model.
- Neuronal Network Recurrent : Model of two arquitectures of Neuronal Network recurrent.
- K-Neighbours Model: Project with the implementation of the model of K-neighbours, along with the implementation of the passwords that are generated by DiceWare.

In addition, there is two data files with extension '*.pth' that are the trainnings that the neuronal networks receive on the notebooks.
